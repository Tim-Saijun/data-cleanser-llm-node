Based on the desired format, I will examine the given data and identify any errors in the city-country mapping. Here are the results:

(1, 0) - No error found. New York is correctly mapped to the United States.
(2, 0) - No error found. London is correctly mapped to the United Kingdom.
(3, 0) - No error found. Paris is correctly mapped to France.
(4, 1) - Error found. Tokyo is incorrectly mapped to China. Tokyo should be mapped to Japan.
(5, 0) - No error found. Sydney is correctly mapped to Australia.

Therefore, the updated data in the desired format is as follows:

(1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0)
```
